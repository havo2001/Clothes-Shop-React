# Clothes-Shop-React

Simple React project for a clothes shop UI. This repository contains the React source in `src/` and a minimal `package.json` so you can install and run the app locally. The website has been deployed and in use for commercial purpose. However, they didn't continue paying for the cloud service so the link is dead and I can't share you.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd /Users/thithuhavo/coding_for_fun/Clothes-Shop-React
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

This uses `react-scripts` (Create React App) by default.

## Notes

- If you see "module not found" errors for a package, install it with `npm install <package>`.
- Sensitive files like `.env` are ignored by `.gitignore`.

## Contributing

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`
2. Make your changes and commit them: `git add . && git commit -m "Describe change"`
3. Push and open a PR: `git push origin feature/your-change`
